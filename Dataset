The entire dataset we have collected consists of only data related to one domine ie. they were the comments about the present Narendra Modi government. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contained 162,981 rows and two columns: 'text' and 'sentiment'. The 'text' column included comments in English collected from Twitter, while the 'sentiment' column represented the nature of sentences using a scale of 1, 0, or -1. A sentiment rating of '0' corresponded to a neutral statement, while a rating of '1' indicated a positive comment, and '-1' indicated a negative comment. More details about the dataset used are mentioned in[3][6].
The dataset used in this work consists of a combination of positive, negative, and neutral. The tweets and comments analyzed were related to opinions about Narendra Modi, other political leaders, and the upcoming Prime Minister of India.
