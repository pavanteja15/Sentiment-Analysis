  In this project, we are going to use various Machine Learning approaches for sentiment analysis of Twitter data. The main purpose of this project is to classify the tweets or sentences into positive, negative, and neutral. In this work, we present an evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, like Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Ensemble techniques like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XG Boost, Ade Boost, Weighted Averaging and Stacking for the classification of sentiment in Twitter tweets.
